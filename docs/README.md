# Keda module

If you want to use Kyma's Keda module, check the [user](/docs/user/) folder to learn more about it. In this folder, you can also find information on how to enable, configure and manage your module and how to create a user interface (UI) for your ScaledObjects custom resource (CR). You can also find a demo application that shows how to scale the Kubernetes workloads using Keda API.

The [contributor](/docs/contributor/) folder includes all the necessary information you may need if you want to extend the module with new features. You can learn more about the project structure, make targets, CI/CD jobs that are part of the developing cycle, and different installation options.
